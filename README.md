# cmb-s4-fls-school
A few files to carry out the CMB-S4 Instrumentation Summer School Frequency-tunable Laser Source (FLS) laser spectroscopy/reflection lab. 

* Notebooks1 and 2 are good to download as they are and are standalones. They don't require any special packages (Notebook1 needs no packages; Notebook2 needs `numpy, matplotlib`, and `scipy`).
* Notebook3 is a bonus notebook and requires installs from other users that are linked in the notebook (haven't uploaded this yet).
* TODO: The images are links from Google Drive but seem to randomly not work on GitHub. Not sure why/how to fix yet (but all the info will be on physical handouts anyway)
