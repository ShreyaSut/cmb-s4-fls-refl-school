A few files to carry out the CMB-S4 Instrumentation Summer School Frequency-tunable Laser Source (FLS) laser spectroscopy/reflection lab. 

* Notebooks1 and 2 are good to download as they are and are standalones. They don't require any special packages (Notebook1 needs no packages; Notebook2 needs `numpy, matplotlib`, and `scipy`).

ðŸ‘‹ **NOTE: You can run these virtually on your browser through Google Colaboratory. Navigate to the Google Drive folder below, then find the files in the folder `GoogleCOLAB Notebooks.` https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dnvBpeqmDDmX2h6gwJYBr5fP7hnbjLUJ?usp=sharing**

Or you can download the files onto your local computer from the folder `Notebooks` in that same Google Drive folder.

* Notebook3 is a bonus fitting notebook using pre-taken data and requires installs from other users that are linked in the notebook (haven't uploaded this yet). This is more of a special interest notebook and for a more hands on lab experience, it will be nice to prioritize measuring a variety of materials instead.
* TODO: The images are links from Google Drive but seem to randomly not work on GitHub. Not sure why/how to fix yet (but all the info will be on physical handouts anyway)
